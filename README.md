# Yacht Resistance Prediction App

## Introduction

The **Yacht Resistance Prediction App** is a machine learning-powered application that aims to simplify and accelerate the process of predicting the resistance of a yacht's hull. Determining the resistance of a ship's hull is a crucial aspect of naval engineering, providing insights into its performance and efficiency. Traditionally, this task has been time-consuming and complex, requiring extensive calculations and simulations. However, with the power of machine learning, we have developed a solution that can provide accurate resistance predictions within seconds.

## Problem Statement

Predicting the resistance of a yacht's hull is challenging due to the intricate interplay of various hydrodynamic factors such as the longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, prismatic coefficient, length-displacement ratio, beam-draught ratio, length-beam ratio, and Froude number. Traditional methods often involve manual calculations and simulation-based approaches, which can be labor-intensive and error-prone.

## Solution

The **Yacht Resistance Prediction App** leverages machine learning algorithms, specifically the XGBoost model, to provide fast and accurate predictions of hull resistance. By analyzing historical data and learning patterns from these hydrodynamic factors, the model can make predictions within a matter of seconds. This eliminates the need for manual calculations and greatly expedites the resistance prediction process.

## Features
